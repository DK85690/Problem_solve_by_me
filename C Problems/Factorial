//Write a program to find factorial 

//Definition 
/*  factorial, in mathematics, the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a given positive integer and denoted by that integer and an exclamation point.
Thus, factorial seven is written 7!, meaning 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7. 
Factorial zero is defined as equal to 1. */

//code

//Using For loop
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
int i=1,n,factorial=1;
     printf("enter a number : ");
     scanf("%d",&n);
     for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
     {
         factorial *=i;
     }
     printf("factorial of %d is : %d\n",n,factorial);
